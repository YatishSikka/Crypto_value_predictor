# Crypto_value_predictor
## Usage
- Use the command ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to install all the dependencies required for this project.
- Save the crpytocurrency price history data file (.csv) in the root directory of the program.
- I have used LiteCoin, hence the filename "LTC-USD.csv". If you wish to choose some other cryptocurrency or your data file name is different then either change the data file name to "LTC_USD.csv" or change the file path in the code before execution.
